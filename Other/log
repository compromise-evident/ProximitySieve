ProximitySieve log



Version 4.0.0   Gap increased to ~400 because now checks with primes < 4,000,000
                Small changes and improvements, fills  proximity_sieve[] to end.

Version 3.0.0   Gap increased to ~308 because proximity_sieve[] is now 1 billion
                in size so there's more space in the  sieve to find bigger gaps.

Version 2.0.0   Prime now has a gap of ~266 with another  prime  in the negative
                direction. This increases  primality likeliness.  (266 is best.)

Version 1.0.0   Perhaps slow because python command is  50,300  characters long.
